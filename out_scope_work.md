## Out of scope work

Sometimes, you'll have to perform work outside of what you'd originally anticipated. There needs to be a system for calculating how {{party 1}} will be paid for extra work caused by changes to the original scope of work.

### {{party 2}} will pay {{party 1}} a pre-agreed hourly rate for any variations that increase the Work Scope.

- If {{party 1}}:
  - provides Services not covered by the Work Scope; and 
  - those Services increase the amount work that {{party 1}} must do in order to complete the Work Scope; then
  - {{party 2}} will pay {{party 1}} a rate of {{payment rate}} for the extra person-hours worked.
- {{party 1}} may invoice {{party 2}} for extra person-hours worked at its discretion, {{party 2}} will pay within {{payment terms}} of receiving the invoice.
