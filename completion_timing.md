## Timing for completion

Use this topic if you need to clarify whether the time frame for a project is a fixed **deadline** or a flexible **estimate**.

### {{party 1}} must finish the Work Scope by a fixed deadline.

{{party 1}} will achieve completion of the Services {{deadline}}.

### There is an estimated, flexible deadline

{{party 1}} estimates that it will complete the Services {{estimate timeframe}}. The parties agree that the time-frame in this clause is an estimate only, and is not binding on {{party 1}}.
