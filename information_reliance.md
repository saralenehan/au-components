## Information and reliance

Services of all kinds often involve conveying information to a person using the service.  As it's hard to make information _completely_ accurate, this topic makes clear how much a person can rely on the information presented (hint: in most cases, not much).

### The {{party 1}} makes it clear that the {{party 2}} should not rely on any information provided as part of the Services.

- {{party 1}} does not promise that any Service Content is complete or correct.
- {{party 2}} agrees that it should verify any Service Content before relying on it in any way.
- {{party 1}} may change the Service Content at its discretion without any warning or notification to the {{party 2}}.
- To the extent that Service Content is third party advertising, {{party 2}} agrees that the {{party 1}} does not endorse the third party advertiser or any of its information, products or services.
