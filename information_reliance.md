## Information and reliance

Services of all kinds often involve conveying information to a person using the service.  As it's hard to make information _completely_ accurate, this topic makes clear how much a person can rely on the information presented (hint: in most cases, not much).

### {{party 1}} makes it clear that {{party 2}} should not rely on any information provided as part of the Services.
