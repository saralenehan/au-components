## Unplanned interruptions

Even services that are perfectly maintained can have unanticipated problems (especially in the world of software). Generally, the more critical that a service is to a customer, the less they can afford interruptions. 

If the service is non-essential, and offered at a reasonably competitive rate, the first clause option is probably correct.

The second option is usually the right one to choose if the Service is essential to {{party 2}}, but be aware that guarantees of uptime usually come at a considerable premium.

### There is no compensation for occasional Service interruptions.

- {{party 2}} acknowledges that:
  - interruptions as a result of third party suppliers to {{party 1}} are beyond the control of {{party 1}}; and
  - the Services may occasionally be interrupted due to technical difficulties.
- {{party 1}} will use reasonable efforts to remedy interruptions to the Services as soon as reasonably practicable.

### Compensation for Service interruptions is set out in an SLA.

{{party 1}} will compensate {{party 2}} for interruptions to the Service in accordance with the SLA at {{SLA URL}}.
