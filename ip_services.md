## Intellectual property

This topic makes clear which party owns the [intellectual property](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/intellectual_property.md) in the product delivered by {{party 1}} to {{party 2}}.

There are 3 options.

**The first option** creates a split where:
- {{party 1}} owns the Background IP; and
- {{party 2}} owns the New IP.

**The second option** gives {{party 1}} ownership of the intellectual property that it creates under the Agreement â€“ {{party 2}} can use it under a licence.  This option is advantageous to {{party 1}}, since it can be reused for future customers.

**The third option** transfers the ownership of all the intellectual property to {{party 2}}. This option is usually only appropriate when {{party 1}} doesn't use any of its Background IP and does not want to reuse what it builds.

### {{party 1}} maintains ownership of the Background IP, {{party 2}} owns the New IP.

- {{party 1}} [transfers ownership of the intellectual property rights](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-ip_transfer/blob/e1f03c73bd15e8ddfa281aeff129154f734eff71/au-ip_transfer.md) in the New IP in the Services IP to {{party 2}}, with the exception of any Background IP.
- {{party 1}} grants a licence to {{party 2}} to the Background IP as described in the table below.
