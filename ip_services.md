## Intellectual property

This topic makes clear which party owns the [intellectual property](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/intellectual_property.md) (sometimes known as IP) in the product delivered by {{party 1}} to {{party 2}}. IP is often a **big source of value**, so it is important to be clear about ownership and use of IP.  It is worth carefully considering which of the options below works best for your circumstances.

There are 3 options.

**The first option** creates a split where:
- {{party 1}} owns the existing background IP; and
- {{party 2}} owns the new IP.

Under **the second option** {{party 1}} keeps ownership of the intellectual property that it creates for {{party 2}}, but {{party 2}} can use the intellectual property under a licence.  This option is really good for {{party 1}}, because it allows {{party 1}} to re-use the same work for future customers.

**The third option** transfers the ownership of all the intellectual property to {{party 2}}. This option gives {{party 2}} control over the IP {{party 1}} provides. This option is usually only appropriate when {{party 1}} doesn't use any of its Background IP and does not want to reuse what it build for {{party 2}}.

### {{party 1}} maintains ownership of the Background IP, {{party 2}} owns the New IP.

- {{party 1}} grants a licence to {{party 2}} to the Background IP as described in the table below.
