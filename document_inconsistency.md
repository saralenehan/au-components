## Document inconsistency resolution

Many service providers have a "work scope" that sets out the work that they're going to do for a customer.  Sometimes different documents making up the agreement conflict.  We need to have a provision that makes clear which of the documents "wins".

In almost all cases, you want the legal document (this document) to win over something like a work scope document, which is usually commercially oriented.  In most cases, it's better for legal text to take precedence over commercial salesmanship! 

### This document will win if it's inconsistent with the Work Scope.

This document will take precedence over the Work Scope to the full extent of any inconsistency between those documents.

### This document will win if it's inconsistent with another document.

This document will take precedence over the other documents that make up the Agreement to the full extent of any inconsistency between them.

### The Work Scope will win if it's inconsistent with this document.

The Work Scope will take precedence over this document to the full extent of any inconsistency between those documents.
