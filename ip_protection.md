### Intellectual Property Protection

- {{party 1}} reserves the right to alter any element of the Product IP at its discretion.
- {{party 2}} agrees not to reverse engineer any part of the Product IP.
- No licence or right is granted over any intellectual property in the Product IP unless explicitly described in the Agreement.
- {{party 2}} does not have any right to resell or sub-licence the Product IP unless the Agreement explicitly provides otherwise.
- If {{party 2}} provides Feedback to {{party 1}}, {{party 2}} [transfers ownership of the intellectual property rights](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-ip_transfer/blob/6d7ad28f3d20fc058b656424a0a5836398ce736f/au-ip_transfer.md) in the Feedback (and any resulting enhancements to the Service) to {{party 1}}.
