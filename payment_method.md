## Payment method

This topic clarifies _when_ the customer will pay the contractor for the services.

- Option 1 is best for services provided at an hourly (or some other) rate.
- Options 2 and 3 are best for work that is based on a project scope.

For larger projects, option 3 is likely the best method – smaller amounts of money change hands, and if the agreement isn’t working, the parties can agree to end it with less money at stake.
