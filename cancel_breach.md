## Cancellation for breach

Sometimes a party won't follow the agreement.  This topic makes clear how the agreement can be cancelled if a party isn't following the agreement.

### If a party breaks the contract, the other party can cancel the contract.

- Either party may cancel the Agreement immediately if:
	- a party notifies the other party of an Agreement breach; and
	- 10 days after the breach notification, the Agreement breach is not remedied.
- Either party may also immediately cancel the Agreement if the other party becomes insolvent.
